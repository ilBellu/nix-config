# My NixOs configurations

Documentation and structure of the config are on their way. Meanwhile I'm including comments in every file both for my future self and whoever decides to fork this repo

Special thanks to github user [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77) who heavely inspired both my switch to NixOs and this configuration.
